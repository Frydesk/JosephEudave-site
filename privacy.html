            Privacy Policy:
            We recommend adding a Privacy Policy to your LittleLink. Adding one can help you stay compliant 
            with different privacy legislation and can also help set expectations for your site visitors.

            This is a boilerplate, what is here may not be applicable to you. By default, we give three sections...

            Analytics: where you can add links to analytic services like Fathom or Google Analytics.

            Content From External Platforms: This could be used for CDN services or additional buttons like GitHub hotlinkable buttons.

            Hosting and Backend Infrastructure: For where you host your LittleLink.

            You can remove, edit, and add to these as necessary for your project.
